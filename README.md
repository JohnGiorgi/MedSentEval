# MedSentEval
## Introduction
Motivated by the work of\cite{Conneau2018SentEval:Representations, PeroneEvaluationTasks}, in their efforts to evaluate sentence representations in a fair and structured approach, this projects aims at replicating their evaluations in the domain-specific settings. We aimed to build on their work and adapt it to fit medical and clinical purposes, we also integrated extra embedding techniques not available in the original toolkit such as ELMO and BERT. 
Our goal is to evaluate text representations algorithms intended mainly for general purpose tasks, and evaluate their transferability to biomedical domain tasks. We use embeddings as input features for solving various downstream problems of biomedical computational linguistics. We hope that our in-depth evaluations along with the toolkit will benefit the BioNLP community in selecting suitable embeddings for different applica-tion tasks. 
Codes and experiments in this repository are based on the original SentEval code with adapttaion to the biomedical domain.
